### Explanation/FAQ

In light of the cancellation of the exhibition at safe house, my group decided to adapt our work to something that we could host online instead. This was an option for us as our group has some experience doing digital work (two of us are computing students), but I appreciate that for others it might be difficult. Because of this we decided that, at the same time as adapting our work, we would create a site to host other people's pieces as well should they choose to make similar adaptations.

#### How does this work?

The site is being hosted on github (here). Github is an online software development service that allows people, provided they have an account and have been given the necessary access, to edit and make changes to the files hosted on the site from their own computer. The reason we have decided to do it this way is so that anyone on the module is able to make an account and be granted access so that they can upload media and work on their page/pages themselves without having to send things back and forth between the groups and us (which would be long and arduous, reliant on a great deal more communication and massively slow down the time it would take to get this going).

#### I don't have any programming experience/aren't interested in doing any programming

This is absolutely fine and we're not expecting everyone to want to handle the html side of things all by themselves. We imagine that most if not all groups will need a fair amount of help getting their work on to the website and displaying/behaving in the way they want it to, and some groups may not want to touch that side of things at all. Our solution to this is basically to use another service called discord, which if you aren't familiar is essentially a private chatroom. The first thing anyone needs to do before they can start working on the site is join the discord via the link at the top of the page. We can then use the discord to organise adding people to the site, discussing things like what the design of the site should be and how to use rudimentary html/css/javascript (or at least where to find these things out) and really just anything pertaining to the exhibition. As well as a communal chat for general organisation, I will also be making individual chatrooms for each group so that we can discuss and organise getting their specific work on to the site. No one is required to do any programming if they don't want: the least that anyone will have to do is upload media (images, sound, video or text) on to github. At the same time, we've set this up in such a way that if groups are interested in doing their own html, css or javascript, then they are absolutely able to and I would encourage anyone who feels like having a go at this to do so; that way you aren't solely reliant on us to try and deliver your group's vision and you can be more creative with the presentation of your work. If there are groups that are intending to do this and you run into issues (which is probably innevitable with programming) then the discord is there for you to ask us for help.

#### What sort of things can I put on the site?

This kind of ties into the last question, but essentially anything you want, depending on how much work you are willing to do to get it working. The more ambitious the project from a technical standpoint, the more work your group will have to do yourselves to get it on the site. What I mean by this is that projects that would require a great deal of user interactivity or dynamic elements will generally require more programming, and there is only so much that we will do for each group because we have to work on our own piece as well. So if you want to have a very complex reactive page/pages, then that's fine but we aren't going to do all that for you. To give you an idea of what I mean by complexity/ambitious projects, I've filled out a table below with some examples:

| Things we can handle all the programming for if necessary | Things you would need to do yourself (with help from us) |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| Displaying/embedding media (images/video/sound) | Interactive media |
| Displaying 3D models | Interactions in a 3D space | 
| Basic styling (fonts/colours etc) | Complex or reactive page layouts |

These are just some hypothetical examples based on what I imagine people might do, but we will take it on a case by case basis so don't be worried by your project being too ambitious initially: we can discuss the practicalities behind/feasibility of each project at length on the discord before we work on getting it on to the site. In order to streamline this process there is a table at the bottom of the page where you can fill out the names of your group members, what your piece is going to be and what you will need to do for it. That way we can create a private discord channel for your group and also have an idea of how ambitious each project is and what would probably be required to get it going. It should go without saying that any kind of media that you want to have on the site will have to come from you. For example, I listed displaying a 3D model as something that we would do fairly easily, but the model itself would have to come from you so if you wanted to display a table you would have to make (or find) the model for that table.

#### How do I make a 3D model?

Ask on the discord but probably more easily than you would think, if your group is interested in doing anything with 3D graphics. There are also plenty of open source assets that you can use that we would be able to get on to the site without any sort of problem.

#### Can we work on our group's page offline and then upload it to github?

Yes you can and if you want to do that and need help getting it going then we'll happily show you how.

#### What is the url for the site?

At the moment it's https://gothubus.github.io/diyexhibition/ but it will be possible to change this to an appropriate custom domain name later on. The reason we haven't yet is because domain names cost money (not a huge amount) and we don't even have people's work on the site yet. Once this has a bit more traction we can look into changing it and maybe goldsmiths will cover the cost of renting out a domain (maybe, if not it's only about Â£10ish which I imagine could be scrounged together between 30 or so people).

#### What's with all the latin?

It's placeholder text so we can see what the website will look like once there is text on there.

#### How do I fill out the table?

Once you're on the discord we'll get your github sorted and then you can edit this very file which you are currently reading in order to fill out the table (there will be a little pencil symbol in the top right of this text box).
